### Q.1. 
Some of the earliest days pf the internet can be traced back to 1960s during the cold war era. It was started as a US defence department program for communicating over a connected, distributed network. This led to a communication project called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). This connected various institutions such as universities, military installations and third-party contractors. 

The first key event in the history of internet in the early 1980s, was the creation of Computer Science Network (CSNET). It was a project for connecting university computer scientists and was funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), a United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education. CSNET was created for departments at academic and research institutes that could not connect to ARPANET and was a major milestone in development of global internet.

The second key event in the history of the internet was the creation of transmission control protocols and internet protocols commonly called TCP/IP protocols, simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) and domain name system (DNS). It was developed by Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) after ARPANET was initiated in 1960s and was implemented between 1978 and 1983. The TCP/IP suite provides end-to-end data communication via packets, addresses, transmission, routing and receiving.  The numerical addresses were assigned hostnames manually via a centralized host table. This was a slow process and not sustainable for a growing network.  Elizabeth Feinler of SRI's Network Information Center (NIC) developed a concept of domains and suggested that they should be based on the address of the computers, such as educational institutions should have a domain edu. Hence, a DNS was created in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris. As ARPANET got bigger, SMTP was developed for standardizing the exchange of messaging between computers and operating systems.

The third key event was the creation of world wide web (WWW) commonly known as the Web. It was a vision of Tim Berners-Lee for creating a hyperlinked information system which became a reality in 1990. The web is an information system for documents and web resources and identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The resources are transferred via hypertext transfer protocols (HTTP) and accessed over a web browser and published by a software application called web server.

The fourth key event was the commercialisation and privatisation of the internet by creation of very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) to provide high-speed interconnection by mid 1990s, which is now a service of Verizon Business. By 1997, IEEE 802.11b wireless networking was introduced and the breakthrough came with the adoption of Wi-Fi by Apple Inc. for their iBook series laptops in 1999. They were the first mass consumer product to offer Wi-Fi network connectivity which was marketed as Airport. Later in 2000 it was followed by IBM with ThinkPad 300 series.

The fifth key event was the creation of internet as a service with the launch AOL dial-up service provider, email, instant messaging and web browser. There were online companies such IMDB, Yahoo, eBay, Craigslist, Hotmail, Google Search, PayPal and Rotten Tomatoes were launched from the early 1990s to mid-1990s. These companies changed the way of internet browsing and are the foundation of today’s  internet services.

### Q.2
**Packets** - A network packet is a formatted data unit that contain control information and user data, called payload. The control information is used for delivering payload via source and destination network addresses, error detection codes and sequencing information. These network packets are transferred over TCP/IP protocols. It is a way of transferring data over the internet.

**IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)** - Internet protocol (IP) address is a numerical label each device that is used for communication with each device. It has a version 4 called IPv4 and version 6 called IPv6. IPv4 addresses are a 32-bit addresses and IPv6 has 128-bit addresses. It helped internet development by defining the origin and destination of the data packet to be sent to and from between the devices.

**Routers and routing** - A router is a device that send and receive a data packet between two devices. It directs a data packet by reading its control information via the routing table and then directs it to the set destination. The directing of the data packet is called routing. It helped the development of the internet as it gave it ability for connecting multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own network or for other networks.
domains and DNS - A Domain Name System (DNS) is a naming system used by computers and services connected over the internet or a private network. It helps translate IP addresses to more memorable domain names.
A domain is a way of identifying different institutions and authorities such as .edu for universities and education institutions and .org for administrations, etc. It helped in the development of the internet by helping to keep tract of the institutions using internet.

### Q.4

**Arrays** – It is a list that is used to store values or list of values. It is defined with square brackets []. The values can be any data type or a mix of data types such as Boolean, Floating points, integers or strings. Each value in the array has an index from which it can be accessed. 
For example, array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], array[0] will print 1. This is called linear array or 1 dimensional array. There can be multidimension arrays such as array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][a, b, c, d, e, f, g][1, e, 4, 5, y, 67, ds, f, 6] is a 3 dimension array. An array can be an array of array, such as, array [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

**Hash** – It is similar to arrays but stores values as key-value pair. It is defined with curly braces {}. This allows for efficient insertion or lookup of data in the list. And similar to arrays its values can vary in data types such as as Boolean, Floating points, integers or strings. 
For example hash{a: => 1, :b=> 2, :c=> 3}, hash[:a] will print 1. And similar to array it can vary from one dimensional to multidimensional and can exit as hashes of arrays.

**Binary trees** – It is a data structure where each node has two children which are referred to as right and left children. It starts at a root value which has two children and then each child is a node for two children. The node and the child nodes and children can all be of any data types. It is usually used in sorting and searching algorithms.




Q.12

For the code, 

celsius = gets

fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32

print "The result is: "

print fahrenheit

puts "."

the error shows: **undefined method `/' for "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n":String (NoMethodError)**

The reason for this error is that "gets" stores a string. And the ruby is not able to convert a string to integer to do the defined operation. Therefore, to fix this, one must use gets.to_f to covert it to floating point or gets.to_i for conversion to an integer.

Q.13
```ruby
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]

sorted = false

while !sorted do
    sorted = true
    for i in 0..arr.size-2
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]
            arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
            sorted = false
        end
    end
end
```
Q.14
```
**Pseudocode**
for a given number n in the range between 1 and 100
    if n is not divisible by 2
        if n is not divisible by 3
            if n is not divisible by 5
            print n
```
