### Q.1. 
Some of the earliest days pf the internet can be traced back to 1960s during the cold war era. It was started as a US defence department program for communicating over a connected, distributed network. This led to a communication project called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). This connected various institutions such as universities, military installations and third-party contractors. 

The first key event in the history of internet in the early 1980s, was the creation of Computer Science Network (CSNET). It was a project for connecting university computer scientists and was funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), a United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education. CSNET was created for departments at academic and research institutes that could not connect to ARPANET and was a major milestone in development of global internet.

The second key event in the history of the internet was the creation of transmission control protocols and internet protocols commonly called TCP/IP protocols, simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) and domain name system (DNS). It was developed by Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) after ARPANET was initiated in 1960s and was implemented between 1978 and 1983. The TCP/IP suite provides end-to-end data communication via packets, addresses, transmission, routing and receiving.  The numerical addresses were assigned hostnames manually via a centralized host table. This was a slow process and not sustainable for a growing network.  Elizabeth Feinler of SRI's Network Information Center (NIC) developed a concept of domains and suggested that they should be based on the address of the computers, such as educational institutions should have a domain edu. Hence, a DNS was created in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris. As ARPANET got bigger, SMTP was developed for standardizing the exchange of messaging between computers and operating systems.

The third key event was the creation of world wide web (WWW) commonly known as the Web. It was a vision of Tim Berners-Lee for creating a hyperlinked information system which became a reality in 1990. The web is an information system for documents and web resources and identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The resources are transferred via hypertext transfer protocols (HTTP) and accessed over a web browser and published by a software application called web server.

The fourth key event was the commercialisation and privatisation of the internet by creation of very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) to provide high-speed interconnection by mid 1990s, which is now a service of Verizon Business. By 1997, IEEE 802.11b wireless networking was introduced and the breakthrough came with the adoption of Wi-Fi by Apple Inc. for their iBook series laptops in 1999. They were the first mass consumer product to offer Wi-Fi network connectivity which was marketed as Airport. Later in 2000 it was followed by IBM with ThinkPad 300 series.

The fifth key event was the creation of internet as a service with the launch AOL dial-up service provider, email, instant messaging and web browser. There were online companies such IMDB, Yahoo, eBay, Craigslist, Hotmail, Google Search, PayPal and Rotten Tomatoes were launched from the early 1990s to mid-1990s. These companies changed the way of internet browsing and are the foundation of today’s  internet services.

### Q.2
**Packets** - A network packet is a formatted data unit that contain control information and user data, called payload. The control information is used for delivering payload via source and destination network addresses, error detection codes and sequencing information. These network packets are transferred over TCP/IP protocols. It is a way of transferring data over the internet.

**IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)** - Internet protocol (IP) address is a numerical label each device that is used for communication with each device. It has a version 4 called IPv4 and version 6 called IPv6. IPv4 addresses are a 32-bit addresses and IPv6 has 128-bit addresses. It helped internet development by defining the origin and destination of the data packet to be sent to and from between the devices.

**Routers and routing** - A router is a device that send and receive a data packet between two devices. It directs a data packet by reading its control information via the routing table and then directs it to the set destination. The directing of the data packet is called routing. It helped the development of the internet as it gave it ability for connecting multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own network or for other networks.
domains and DNS - A Domain Name System (DNS) is a naming system used by computers and services connected over the internet or a private network. It helps translate IP addresses to more memorable domain names.
A domain is a way of identifying different institutions and authorities such as .edu for universities and education institutions and .org for administrations, etc. It helped in the development of the internet by helping to keep tract of the institutions using internet.

### Q. 3
**TCP** – Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides delivery of packets with reliability and error free between application running on hosts vi IP network. some of the services that rely on the TCP are World Wide Web (WWW), remote administrations and file transfer via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). It keeps track of the segments which are units of data transmission. 
It provides host to host communication at the transport layer of the internet. It handles all the handshaking and transmission details and present that to application via abstraction of the network connection. TCP also detects problems such as loss of IP packets and duplication.
In the development of client and server, it establishes a two-way connection between a server and a single client and provides transmission of data.

**HTTP and HTTPS** – Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application level protocol for distributed. Collaborative and hypermedia information systems. Hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that users can access such as a tap on the screen or click of a mouse. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of HTTP and provide a secure communication over the network.
In the development of client and server, HTTP contributes by allowing access to resources hosted on a server by a client.

**web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)** – It is a software application for accessing information over world wide web (WWW). The process of fetching information happens via Uniform Resource Locator (URL) with HTTP as a prefix. This means that browser retrieves information with the help of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
It contributes to the development of client and server by retrieving content requested by a user from a web server and displays it on the user’s device.

### Q.4

**Arrays** – It is a list that is used to store values or list of values. It is defined with square brackets []. The values can be any data type or a mix of data types such as Boolean, Floating points, integers or strings. Each value in the array has an index from which it can be accessed. 
For example, array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], array[0] will print 1. This is called linear array or 1 dimensional array. There can be multidimension arrays such as array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][a, b, c, d, e, f, g][1, e, 4, 5, y, 67, ds, f, 6] is a 3 dimension array. An array can be an array of array, such as, array [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

**Hash** – It is similar to arrays but stores values as key-value pair. It is defined with curly braces {}. This allows for efficient insertion or lookup of data in the list. And similar to arrays its values can vary in data types such as as Boolean, Floating points, integers or strings. 
For example hash{a: => 1, :b=> 2, :c=> 3}, hash[:a] will print 1. And similar to array it can vary from one dimensional to multidimensional and can exit as hashes of arrays.

**Binary trees** – It is a data structure where each node has two children which are referred to as right and left children. It starts at a root value which has two children and then each child is a node for two children. The node and the child nodes and children can all be of any data types. It is usually used in sorting and searching algorithms.

### Q.5
**Interpreters** – An interpreter is a computer program, which coverts each high-level program statement into the machine code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. It converts code into machine code after the program has finished running. For example, some of the high-level languages that uses interpreter are JavaScript, Perl, Python, Ruby.

Some of the features of an interpreter are,

- Can only run on computers that have corresponding interpreter
- Doesn’t save machine code
- Doesn’t generate output program, hence source program is evaluated every time during execution
- It exists in the memory during execution
- It reads code line by line and shows error and mut be corrected to execute the next line of code
- Doesn’t generate any intermediate machine code
- Best suited for development environment

**Compilers** – A compiler is a program that transforms code written in a high-level programming language to machine code. And the computer performs the corresponding tasks. For example, some of the high-level languages that uses compiler are C, C++, Java, and ML.

Some of the features of compilers are,

- Less execution time
- Stores machine code as machine language
- Compiled code run faster
- Best suited for production environment
- Takes an entire program and run it
- Generate output program in the form of exe which can run independently from original program
- Program execution is separate from compilation. It is after entire output program is compiled
- Do not require compiler in memory 
- Reports error after compiling is finished

### Q.6
The two most commonly used programming languages are Java and JavaScript.

JavaScript- It was developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape, Inc during the early years of the internet in 1990. It was created in 10 days and instruct computer in ways to interact with user input.

Benefits:
- It is an opensource language designed for small scripts but can be extended to large projects
- It supports classes, interfaces and modules
- It is an interpreted language and run in any browser and allow cross-compilation
- Allow to create interfaces that react when the user hovers using mouse
Drawbacks:
- Client side doesn’t allow the reading or writing of files for security reasons
- Can’t be used to network applications due to lack of support
- Lack of multiprocessor or multi-threading

Java – it is a programming language invented by James Gosling and developed by Sun Microsystems. It was first released in 1995 and several new versions has been launched since then. It is currently owned by Oracle.

Benefits: 
- A large pool of skilled developers are available
- Has big array of 3rd party libraries that are easy to navigate
- It is a compiled language and produces a reusable code that can be used on any platform
- It can multi-task due to multi-thread environment
- It is faster to run

Drawbacks:
- JIT compiler makes the program comparatively slow
- Has high memory and processing requirements
- Doesn’t support low-level programming constructs like pointers
- No control over garbage collection such as delete() or free().

### Q.7
The number of people engaged in IT professional are increasing after the advent of electronic computer in the 1940’s. As laws for computers did not exist, the professional organizations started to exercise their own codes of ethics. These ethical codes addressed questions like: Can you read other people’s computer files? Is using software written by organization be utilized by a diverse organization? Although some ethical concerns have been addressed, the development of the computer professional urged the main organizations of computer professionals to draft their own code. For computing professionals, such codes have been developed by ACM, the British Computer Society (BCS), the, IEEE-CS, the AITP, the Hong Kong Computer Society, the Systems Administrators Special Interest Group of USENEX (SAGE), and other associations.

**Ethical Issue 1: Access to user’s personal information**

The Privacy Act 1988 “regulates and protects the personal information from misuse, interference, loss, and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure by certain organizations and Australian government agencies”. Additionally, it also incorporates the crucial steps necessary to destroy or de-identify personal information that they hold once it is no longer desirable (unless an exception applies) as depicted in Figure 1.  One should contemplate how the personal information during the stages of its life cycle must be protected.

![information cycle](https://github.com/achman1729/workbook/blob/master/doc/pic.png)

As an effective IT professional, it is crucial for the protection of both hardware and software from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorized access, modification and disclosure. Additionally, the IT professional should always check that the hardware, software and personal information kept on the system/server remain available and beneficial to authorized users. Moreover, the notifiable data breach (NDB) “scheme gives the flexibility to affected individuals and the Australian Information Commissioner (Commissioner), in the event of an ‘eligible data breach’” [4]. Also, it lets to conduct a quick and reasonable evaluation if they doubt that they may have experienced an eligible data breach. 

**Ethical Issue 2: intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement**

Copyrights are utilized to protect a diverse range of work and have developed dynamically since the introduction of intellectual property right. Copyright has a practical method and can be stretched to diverse range of work regardless of quality and subject. copyright law protects computer software including computer programs, computer files, printed documents or database. Moreover, the information technology industries rely profoundly on IP law to protect their products and other assets. 
Intellectual property (IP) is defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) “creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. The owner of intellectual property has monopoly of its use. Intellectual property is protected by laws, including patents, copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws.” [5]

Computing professionals must protect the integrity of intellectual property. Specifically, one must not take credit for other’s ideas or work, given the scenario that the work has not been protected by copyright, patent, etc. The ethical concern is to respect all obligations of privacy to employers, clients, and users unless cleared from such obligations by requirements of the law or other principles of this Code.

However, optimization of IP, copyright and technology (IT) can be crucial as the IT professionals need to have a better understanding of the challenges involved. As an It professional, “IT contracts including software development, licensing, distribution, maintenance and support agreements, software as a service (SaaS) agreements, cloud services agreements, dispute resolution service agreements and customer contracts”.

**CASE STUDY: AAPT and Melbourne IT: Own motion investigation report** 

**Background**

“On July 2012, it was found that a server was accessed by anonymous to access and transfer (unauthorized) AAPT data which was then published on the internet. This data was held on a server managed by a unit of Melbourne IT. The compromised server held series of websites and database that incorporated personal information about AATP business customer that was collected or the purpose of obtaining credit reports of AAPT business customers and information used for the purpose of transferring telephone numbers from other telecommunications carriers”. [4]

**Provision of the Ethical code**

The Privacy Act complies with 10 National Privacy Principles (NPPs) and in this incident it was relevant to NPP 4 (Data security) and NPP 2 (Use and disclosure) which states [2]:
NPP 4.1: “requires organizations to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information they hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.”
NPP 4.2: “if an organization no longer needs personal information for any purpose under NPP 2, then the organization must take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify it.”
NPP 2.1: “provides that an organization may only use or disclose personal information for the primary purpose of collection, unless an exception applies.”

**Response of an IT professional**

To address the issues that has been identified there are various steps that an IT professional can take to prevent the ethical breaches:

1. The first and foremost response of an IT professional should be to take the server offline immediately in order to investigate and rectify the issue.

2. The configuration change to the server would stop any more breach of the data.

3. To undertake vulnerability assessment and testing of all IT applications internally and externally that hold or utilize personal information. 

4. Ensure that security measures are working effectively and complies well with the policies and procedures related to data security

5. Undertake steps to ensure proper classification of data i.e., internally or externally and whether it includes personal information or sensitive information.

6. As a part of the IT security, it is crucial to reassess which users require Tier 1 access and if required create an additional access Tier and if the identity information/documents can be masked from external sources.

**Conclusion**

These recommendations can be implied to rectify and investigate the issue. Additionally, IT team can conduct regular vulnerability scanning and implement an effective life cycle management. Also, reasonable steps must be implied to destroy or permanently de-identify the information that was no longer required by the company. The IT professionals play crucial steps in various ways therefore regular training in relation to data security policies, including data retention and destruction cannot be overlooked.

### Q.8

A control flow is a language feature that breaks the normal progression of the code to the next statement and conditionally or unconditionally branches to another location in source code. For example, consider the code below 

``` ruby
a = 1

if a == 0
  puts "a is zero"
elsif a == 1
  puts "a is one"
elsif a >= 1
  puts "a is greater than or equal to one"
else
  puts "a is some other value"
end
```

The above code will print according to the value of a. If a is 0 it will print "a is zero". If a is not zero then it will jump to the next line and check if a is equal to 1, if it is then prints "a is one". It a is not equal to 1, it will then jump to next condition to check if a is greater than one or equal to one. If it is, then it will print "a is greater than or equal to one". If the value of a matches none of the condition, it then prints “a is some other value”.

### Q.9
Type coercion is a process of converting value from one type to another type, such as string to integer. 

There are two types of coercion

Explicit coercion – it is a the conversion of types by writing appropriate code, such as number (‘123’) converts a string of 123 into a number 123. 

Implicit coercion – it happens when one applies operators to values of different types, such as 2/ ‘5’ or 123 + ‘245 ’ changes the string to a number to do the operation. 

### Q.10
Data types are attributes of data that informs the compiler or interpreter the usage of supplied data. Some basing data types are, 
- integer: 123 or -1234
- Floating-point number: 345.345 or -12334.34534
- Characters: ‘a’ or ‘b’ or ‘@’
- String: “Hello world”
- Boolean: a = true or a = false, here a is Boolean data type 

### Q.11
The whole operation of the restaurant can be divided into four parts, Waiter, Bar, Kitchen and Cashier. Hence, the names of the classes can be, 

class Waiter
-	show menu with list of dishes
-	shows menu with drinks
-	stores the chosen dishes and drinks
-	sends the list of dishes to cook
-	sends the list of drinks to bar
-	waits for the message for list of dishes and drinks to be ready
-	once receive the message from bar and cook, presents the selected drinks and dishes with drinks served first 
-	after the customer finish drinks and eating food, sends the list of selected drinks and dishes to cashier
-	receives the message from cashier for list of bill to be ready
-	receives the list of bill
-	presents the list of bill to the customer
-	receives payment from customer

class Bar
-	take the list of drinks from the waiter
-	will look up the recipe for the chosen drinks
-	prepare the drink
-	sends a message to the waiter for collection
-	the waiter collects the drinks from the bar
class Cashier
-	receives the list of drinks and dishes from waiter
-	generates a list of bill by referencing the price list
-	send the message for collection of list of bill to waiter
-	sends the list of bill to waiter

class Kitchen
-	take the list of dishes from the waiter
-	will look up the recipe for the chosen dishes
-	prepare the dishes
-	sends a message to the waiter for collection
-	the waiter collects the dishes from the kitchen

### Q.12

For the code, 
``` ruby
celsius = gets

fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32

print "The result is: "

print fahrenheit

puts "."
```
the error shows: **undefined method `/' for "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n":String (NoMethodError)**

The reason for this error is that "gets" stores a string. And the ruby is not able to convert a string to integer to do the defined operation. Therefore, to fix this, one must use gets.to_f to covert it to floating point or gets.to_i for conversion to an integer.

### Q.13
```ruby
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]

sorted = false

while !sorted do
    sorted = true
    for i in 0..arr.size-2
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]
            arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
            sorted = false
        end
    end
end
```
### Q.14
```
**Pseudocode**
for a given number n in the range between 1 and 100
    if n is not divisible by 2
        if n is not divisible by 3
            if n is not divisible by 5
            print n
```

### Q.15

**Pseudocode**
```
if raining equals true
    if temperature is less than 15 degrees
        print "It's wet and cold"
    else
        print "It's warm and raining"
else
    if temperature is less than 15 degrees
        print "It's not raining but cold"
    else
        print "It's warm but not raining"
```

### Q.16
``` ruby
def allergy_test(score)
    items = {1=>"eggs", 2=>"peanuts", 4=>"shellfish", 8=>"strawberries", 16=>"tomatoes", 32=>"chocolate", 64=>"pollen", 128=>"cats"}

        if num == 1
            allergic_items << items[2**i] 
        end
    end

    return allergic_items

        2. list of allergies"
    
        option = gets.to_i
        case option
        when 1      #to check allergy for an item
            puts "please enter the item to check: "
            item = gets.chomp
            if allergy_test(score).include?(item)
                puts "you are allergic to this item"
            end
        when 2      #to print the list of items allergic
            puts "you are allergic to: "
            puts allergy_test(score)
        end
    else
        puts "invalid input"
    end
end
